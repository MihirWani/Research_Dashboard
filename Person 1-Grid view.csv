Analyst 1,1,India-UK Free Trade Agreement(FTA),"The trade deal, once implemented, may make import of whisky, gin, automobiles, medical devices, electrical machinery, cosmetics, soft drinks, chocolates, and lamb cheaper for India. It will also lead to significant increase in export competitiveness of Indian shipments in the UK for sectors like textiles, toys, leather, marine products, footwear, and gems & jewellery. Sensitive items like dairy products, apples, cheese, etc, have been excluded from any duty concession by India to protect its farmers. 

both nations also concluded a double-contribution convention or a social security pact that will give Indian skilled professionals working in Britain a three-year exemption from social security payments. It will lead to savings of around 20 per cent of employee salaries

However, the contentious bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between both the countries could not be finalised .

The agreement is set to come into effect within 12 months, pending ratification by both governments.

India has reduced import tariffs on whisky and gin from 150 per cent to 75 per cent, before slashing them to 40 per cent by year 10 of the deal. Automotive tariffs will go from over 100 per cent to 10 per cent under a quota. 

India will gain from tariff elimination by the UK on about 99 per cent of products, covering almost 100 per cent of the trade value. Indian tariffs will be slashed, locking in reductions on 90 per cent of tariff lines, with 85 per cent of these becoming fully tariff-free within a decade.

 UK businesses anticipate cost savings of up to £900 million over a decade due to reduced tariffs.
The total trade between both countries stood at $21.33 billion during 2024-25. Exports from India stood at $12.9 billion, up 13.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y). Imports from the UK stood at $8.4 billion, down 6.1 per cent Y-o-Y.

Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), said the deal’s true test would lie in how the UK’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is handled. If Indian exports still face CBAM levies while UK goods enter India duty-free, it risks turning a balanced FTA into a one-sided bargain. Let’s hope this elephant in the room wasn’t ignored.

The United Kingdom is set to implement its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) starting January 1, 2027. This policy aims to impose a carbon price on certain imported goods to align with the UK's domestic carbon pricing, thereby preventing carbon leakage and promoting global emission reductions. Aluminum, cement, fertilizers, hydrogen, and iron and steel. Initially proposed sectors like glass and ceramics have been excluded due to feasibility concerns but may be considered in the future. Importers with annual imports of CBAM-covered goods exceeding £50,000 will be subject to the mechanism, an increase from the initially proposed £10,000 threshold. he EU requires the purchase and surrender of CBAM certificates, whereas the UK plans to apply a direct tax without a certificate trading system.",,"Alcoholic Beverage, Auto, Medical Devices, Electrical Machinery, Textiles, Footwear, Jewellery.",https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/statsguru-india-uk-fta-set-to-boost-british-investment-prospects-125051100445_1.html,Business Standard,,"Picture14.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/41/41/1748224800000/Xezn6lV9eCrg6jZ7J4hK9w/_H32GleJ11TkJV0jHW3zbDDUMJXToLrQcgzBN5_NBgfPq2bEBpwv6gLYkmkvEqe-kTOeyTzyJ5zB06nBPBPvIy-tnjsY3d26NN-ISM_w9ZnyGlKBth_0P4REa-Eg_ob-EpLbS85YyEhoLwE4gP09FzMLjG5hENqmVQE1IgF4QWE/mNxR2XXa8K3Fe5zGB5ck3Gw3Bke1uCxyarKtgq-Wz2I),Picture13.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/41/41/1748224800000/YMpIulbIwEdwhsYab-ZENA/4iALnDbQBg5jEaeeT0vuPpIqh58gqwA8J286Fpkybq82v8NaekeIUU4CoqzZtAGYQydTEi2aanX936Rgo9lpBuistVUz4UVd1PRWYnOfakXF9HTL7s2YpP0odRa9KRmcRk81WazJTyKGKk9cnNsTiyKbb4KaGMXBokb-anZcPws/KUuJ0mUWO_B1ea7LJGKVDvCfCROlSoElwlEdKQfY7uY),Picture12.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/41/41/1748224800000/UxVeUVswuSiqB_ZsK_kM7g/VIy0wB7m5xhlo7jxsnMbmoBdFJsGAJQYqF_5Y6OKIwhSn_5f93YLCMpBbp7AuEQG7u3yfEONzl58XwD-4-gxxnD6OokzX3ERDIoU6LAE7KaaZ6J7nkgeKestn6mrcZqeJmd2oyagIClvHymbhTkGjDGh_Q7uvGygH4qsofStiRM/DB83F8nKUTG1c5e35BaafMZY_4rMmITyVFuOeYx2YE0),Picture11.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/41/41/1748224800000/BCJvNMYi2Nir7DdisJ6WKQ/zVfyT70hzhPb91m_01CVdxjEFYBM2yBdmADC2AGtsiYicDurpN4jpBSwqWZkKtmih6eZ13tVVXk3yV8oRjfGj_AsBI8hAJli6NO0Gx_-SjTcQArJyGbnyhCtSuknCcSVz7RxGptLlsVviApOcqP7HLu12J_-J9KHJWWC5CSkr8U/k5Axk7yFqWLT3g-uYYgT8xUvfZHNZdOF3c-4RmHfXco),Picture10.jpg (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/41/41/1748224800000/B_qDDrOFmTNjB73o8lNqiQ/IL5mEC35j6XdQsaqIZTY5XNsEI1fZDhB4V9BeuMzwcEY9323LKQny5WDJIk5ChDaBRc8yiNczTfuRgzWCaZHPK1OkNrw2G0SZNYr6fmfGTD38uVL3ycpl8Y3JjoNniJCOo6Nf-aqso2ThQhrJAhYs9WUMvVfk7UUAe5fSzNOE9c/MbcaiZfQhMLU17Nwgbh3WzTRzoXbBz52sR1kWx7VaXo),Picture9.png (https://v5.airtableusercontent.com/v3/u/41/41/1748224800000/2j0_JvbdcfuGfSh3T9aicQ/OiuK1YmuHVIkA16DUaM7MNITMBfO50AkLW491nY7FKjKA0xbDmrXAlY36EWYIaL-bxY5odNCDzqcvxZFCgOoquT6RgVQOYir23SESoH8f-fnKKqk8vUkrnLcMu31bF4oC8y9VeiGAt06t9H_90VkhqF_gCs1caOprs5DF4LmmCc/d3uPENVyEZW6BYEvHh__6QqPn0Sw7YRBVrgwUaVmTos)"

would be divided into various sub-sectors like road transport, railways, ports, shipping, and civil aviation.
Road transport is the largest contributor to pollution in the country, accounting for 12 per cent of India’s energy-related carbon dioxide emissions and contributing significantly to urban air pollution. Among all transportation modes in India, road transport is expected to take the longest to become carbon-neutral.
Under current frameworks, the international shipping and aviation sectors aim to transition to net-zero emissions by 2050. ",,"Transport, Logistics, Auto",,Business Standard,,
Analyst 1,4,PE/VC Landscape in India intensifies,"the number of PEs involved in deals in India has gone up by over 60-65 per cent between 2016, when there were between 100 and 110 funds, to as many as 170-180 funds in 2024. In 2024, global funds accounted for 50-55 per cent of the total number of funds, from 40-50 per cent in 2016.

The other clear trend is that PE investors are increasingly gravitating towards buyouts. As a result, the share of buyouts in overall PE deal-making has gone up sharply from 37 per cent in 2022 to 51 per cent in 2024. As far as 2025 is concerned, the report says that ageing assets held by PE and VC funds for a longer period of time are expected to accelerate buyout deals.

Despite that, by the close of 2024, India-focused funds accounted for 10 per cent of all the funds raised in that year in the Asia Pacific region, up from 7 per cent in 2016. However, in the same period, pan-Asia funds, which have a substantial allocation for India, have gone up from 36 per cent to 57 per cent.

To look at the trend from another perspective, small buyouts ($250 million and below) continued to gain share, making up to 68 per cent of all buyouts in 2024 compared to only 55 per cent in 2023, and 40 per cent in 2022. Buyouts in the $500 million-1 billion category have also risen from 9 per cent in 2023 to 14 per cent in 2024 across all such deals.

In simple terms, it means that in 2025, nearly 83 per cent of deals that are over five years old could come up for exits, partial or complete, giving a big push to exits.",,,,Business Standard,,
