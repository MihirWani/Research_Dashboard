It will also lead to significant increase in export competitiveness of Indian shipments in the UK for sectors like textiles, toys, leather, marine products, footwear, and gems & jewellery. Sensitive items like dairy products, apples, cheese, etc, have been excluded from any duty concession by India to protect its farmers. 

both nations also concluded a double-contribution convention or a social security pact that will give Indian skilled professionals working in Britain a three-year exemption from social security payments. It will lead to savings of around 20 per cent of employee salaries

However, the contentious bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between both the countries could not be finalised .

The agreement is set to come into effect within 12 months, pending ratification by both governments.

India has reduced import tariffs on whisky and gin from 150 per cent to 75 per cent, before slashing them to 40 per cent by year 10 of the deal. Automotive tariffs will go from over 100 per cent to 10 per cent under a quota. 

India will gain from tariff elimination by the UK on about 99 per cent of products, covering almost 100 per cent of the trade value. Indian tariffs will be slashed, locking in reductions on 90 per cent of tariff lines, with 85 per cent of these becoming fully tariff-free within a decade.

 UK businesses anticipate cost savings of up to £900 million over a decade due to reduced tariffs.
The total trade between both countries stood at $21.33 billion during 2024-25. Exports from India stood at $12.9 billion, up 13.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y). Imports from the UK stood at $8.4 billion, down 6.1 per cent Y-o-Y.

Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), said the deal’s true test would lie in how the UK’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is handled. If Indian exports still face CBAM levies while UK goods enter India duty-free, it risks turning a balanced FTA into a one-sided bargain. Let’s hope this elephant in the room wasn’t ignored.

The United Kingdom is set to implement its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) starting January 1, 2027. This policy aims to impose a carbon price on certain imported goods to align with the UK's domestic carbon pricing, thereby preventing carbon leakage and promoting global emission reductions. Aluminum, cement, fertilizers, hydrogen, and iron and steel. Initially proposed sectors like glass and ceramics have been excluded due to feasibility concerns but may be considered in the future. Importers with annual imports of CBAM-covered goods exceeding £50,000 will be subject to the mechanism, an increase from the initially proposed £10,000 threshold. he EU requires the purchase and surrender of CBAM certificates, whereas the UK plans to apply a direct tax without a certificate trading system.",4,"India and the UK reached a free trade agreement (FTA) that aims to boost economic ties between the world’s fifth- and sixth largest economies, among the first such global accords in the Trump tariff era.

Sensitive items such as dairy products, apples and cheese have been excluded from any duty concession by India to protect its farmers, the Centre said.

New Delhi has secured an exemption for Indian workers who are temporarily in the UK and their employers from paying social security contributions there for three years under the Double Contribution Convention. This will make Indian service providers more competitive in the UK, with savings pegged at around 20% of salaries. This is expected to benefit more than 60,000 IT sector employees alone.

The other clear trend is that PE investors are increasingly gravitating towards buyouts. As a result, the share of buyouts in overall PE deal-making has gone up sharply from 37 per cent in 2022 to 51 per cent in 2024. As far as 2025 is concerned, the report says that ageing assets held by PE and VC funds for a longer period of time are expected to accelerate buyout deals.

The percentage of deals in which PEs realised their entire returns went down declined from 38 per cent to more than half at 17 per cent in the same period.

The EU said on Tuesday that Trump’s ongoing trade investigations will boost the amount of the bloc’s goods facing tariffs to €549 billion.

The new EU counter-measure list will come on top of the €21 billion of US goods already targeted by EU levies in response to Trump’s 25% duty on steel and aluminum exports. The EU agreed earlier this month to delay for 90 days the implementation of those measures after the US lowered its so-called reciprocal rate on most EU exports to 10% from 20% while the negotiations are taking place.

In addition, the EU has also offered to buy more US goods including liquefied natural gas or soybeans, one option that helped to diffuse tensions between the two longstanding allies during Trump’s first term.

The US has instead focused on issues such as the bloc’s rules policing technology companies, digital levies as well as the EU’s value-added tax. The commission has refused so far to negotiate about its tech rules and says that its VAT is a fair, non-discriminatory tax that applies equally to domestic and imported goods.

The US currently has tariffs on €380 billion of EU exports, around 70% of its total exports to the American market, at rates between 10% and 25%. The bloc has said it won’t seek a retaliate with tit-for-tat tariffs and instead will try inflict the maximum pain while minimizing the impact on the European supply chain.

In 2024, the EU exported €531.6 billion in goods to the US and imported €333.4 billion, resulting in a €198.2 billion trade surplus, according to Eurostat. If services are added the picture however is more balanced as the US registers a surplus in this segment. The difference between EU exports to the US and US exports to the EU stood at €48 billion in 2023; the equivalent of just 3% of the total trade between the EU and the US.",0.769
