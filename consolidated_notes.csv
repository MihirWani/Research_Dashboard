Analyst 1,1,India-UK Free Trade Agreement(FTA),"The trade deal, once implemented, may make import of whisky, gin, automobiles, medical devices, electrical machinery, cosmetics, soft drinks, chocolates, and lamb cheaper for India. It will also lead to significant increase in export competitiveness of Indian shipments in the UK for sectors like textiles, toys, leather, marine products, footwear, and gems & jewellery. Sensitive items like dairy products, apples, cheese, etc, have been excluded from any duty concession by India to protect its farmers. 

both nations also concluded a double-contribution convention or a social security pact that will give Indian skilled professionals working in Britain a three-year exemption from social security payments. It will lead to savings of around 20 per cent of employee salaries

However, the contentious bilateral investment treaty (BIT) between both the countries could not be finalised .

The agreement is set to come into effect within 12 months, pending ratification by both governments.

India has reduced import tariffs on whisky and gin from 150 per cent to 75 per cent, before slashing them to 40 per cent by year 10 of the deal. Automotive tariffs will go from over 100 per cent to 10 per cent under a quota. 

India will gain from tariff elimination by the UK on about 99 per cent of products, covering almost 100 per cent of the trade value. Indian tariffs will be slashed, locking in reductions on 90 per cent of tariff lines, with 85 per cent of these becoming fully tariff-free within a decade.

 UK businesses anticipate cost savings of up to £900 million over a decade due to reduced tariffs.
The total trade between both countries stood at $21.33 billion during 2024-25. Exports from India stood at $12.9 billion, up 13.3 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y). Imports from the UK stood at $8.4 billion, down 6.1 per cent Y-o-Y.

Ajay Srivastava, founder of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), said the deal’s true test would lie in how the UK’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) is handled. If Indian exports still face CBAM levies while UK goods enter India duty-free, it risks turning a balanced FTA into a one-sided bargain. Let’s hope this elephant in the room wasn’t ignored.

The United Kingdom is set to implement its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) starting January 1, 2027. This policy aims to impose a carbon price on certain imported goods to align with the UK's domestic carbon pricing, thereby preventing carbon leakage and promoting global emission reductions. Aluminum, cement, fertilizers, hydrogen, and iron and steel. Initially proposed sectors like glass and ceramics have been excluded due to feasibility concerns but may be considered in the future. Importers with annual imports of CBAM-covered goods exceeding £50,000 will be subject to the mechanism, an increase from the initially proposed £10,000 threshold. he EU requires the purchase and surrender of CBAM certificates, whereas the UK plans to apply a direct tax without a certificate trading system.",,"Alcoholic Beverage, Auto, Medical Devices, Electrical Machinery, Textiles, Footwear, Jewellery.",https://www.business-standard.com/economy/news/statsguru-india-uk-fta-set-to-boost-british-investment-prospects-125051100445_1.html,Business Standard,,,P1_1,1,TRUE

In 2024, global funds accounted for 50-55 per cent of the total number of funds, from 40-50 per cent in 2016.

The other clear trend is that PE investors are increasingly gravitating towards buyouts. As a result, the share of buyouts in overall PE deal-making has gone up sharply from 37 per cent in 2022 to 51 per cent in 2024. As far as 2025 is concerned, the report says that ageing assets held by PE and VC funds for a longer period of time are expected to accelerate buyout deals.

Despite that, by the close of 2024, India-focused funds accounted for 10 per cent of all the funds raised in that year in the Asia Pacific region, up from 7 per cent in 2016. However, in the same period, pan-Asia funds, which have a substantial allocation for India, have gone up from 36 per cent to 57 per cent.

To look at the trend from another perspective, small buyouts ($250 million and below) continued to gain share, making up to 68 per cent of all buyouts in 2024 compared to only 55 per cent in 2023, and 40 per cent in 2022. Buyouts in the $500 million-1 billion category have also risen from 9 per cent in 2023 to 14 per cent in 2024 across all such deals.

The EU said on Tuesday that Trump’s ongoing trade investigations will boost the amount of the bloc’s goods facing tariffs to €549 billion.

The new EU counter-measure list will come on top of the €21 billion of US goods already targeted by EU levies in response to Trump’s 25% duty on steel and aluminum exports. The EU agreed earlier this month to delay for 90 days the implementation of those measures after the US lowered its so-called reciprocal rate on most EU exports to 10% from 20% while the negotiations are taking place.

In addition, the EU has also offered to buy more US goods including liquefied natural gas or soybeans, one option that helped to diffuse tensions between the two longstanding allies during Trump’s first term.

The US has instead focused on issues such as the bloc’s rules policing technology companies, digital levies as well as the EU’s value-added tax. The commission has refused so far to negotiate about its tech rules and says that its VAT is a fair, non-discriminatory tax that applies equally to domestic and imported goods.

Analyst 2,35,," Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Tuesday proposed a separate carve-out for voluntary delisting of public sector undertakings (PSUs) where the government holding is over 90 per cent.

Such PSUs may be allowed to be delisted without the requirement of complying with the minimum public shareholding norms, which mandate 25 per cent holding by the public in a listed entity. The mandate for two-third shareholder approval for delisting may also be removed.

In the consultation paper floated on Tuesday, the market regulator said that eligible PSUs may be delisted through a fixed price delisting process, irrespective of whether the shares are frequently traded or not. However, the fixed delisting price will be at least 15 per cent premium over the floor price.

“If such PSUs are to undertake delisting, being frequently traded, the 60 days’ volume weighted average market price shall be required to be taken into consideration, which will result into higher floor price and consequently result into higher budgetary outlay for the government,”",,,,,,,P2_35,15,TRUE

Synoptics raised ₹35 crore from the public. Sebi’s probe showed that around 54 per cent of the issue proceeds, amounting to ₹19 crore, were siphoned off to a set of entities under the directions of the merchant banker.

The order also casts a shadow of investigation on 20 other SMEs listed on the stock exchanges which were undertaken by the First Overseas Capital as a merchant banker. Sebi stated that it will examine the utilisation of funds raised by these SMEs to identify if a similar modus operandi was adopted. These were the assignments undertaken by the merchant banker from May 2022 to April 2025.",,,,,,,P2_36,16,TRUE
Analyst 2,37,,"The decision of the Mumbai International Airport Limited (Mial) to discontinue cargo flight operations from August 16 could “severely” impact the country's export-import (Exim) trade by driving up freight rates and causing delays in delivery, warned the Air Cargo Agents Association of India (ACAAI) in a letter to the Ministry of Civil Aviation (MoCA).

the airport manages around 28 per cent of the nation’s total international air cargo volume.

The construction of a parallel taxiway for Runway 14/32 required “temporary” relocation of certain cargo facilities and this was disclosed and discussed during the recent tariff consultation process at Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India (AERA), the operator mentioned.
