Analyst 2,21,,"The European Union plans to hit about €100 billion ($113 billion) in US goods with additional tariffs in the event ongoing trade talks fail to yield a satisfactory result for the bloc, according to people familiar with the matter.

The EU said on Tuesday that Trump’s ongoing trade investigations will boost the amount of the bloc’s goods facing tariffs to €549 billion.

The new EU counter-measure list will come on top of the €21 billion of US goods already targeted by EU levies in response to Trump’s 25% duty on steel and aluminum exports. The EU agreed earlier this month to delay for 90 days the implementation of those measures after the US lowered its so-called reciprocal rate on most EU exports to 10% from 20% while the negotiations are taking place.

In addition, the EU has also offered to buy more US goods including liquefied natural gas or soybeans, one option that helped to diffuse tensions between the two longstanding allies during Trump’s first term.

The US has instead focused on issues such as the bloc’s rules policing technology companies, digital levies as well as the EU’s value-added tax. The commission has refused so far to negotiate about its tech rules and says that its VAT is a fair, non-discriminatory tax that applies equally to domestic and imported goods.

The US currently has tariffs on €380 billion of EU exports, around 70% of its total exports to the American market, at rates between 10% and 25%. The bloc has said it won’t seek a retaliate with tit-for-tat tariffs and instead will try inflict the maximum pain while minimizing the impact on the European supply chain.

In 2024, the EU exported €531.6 billion in goods to the US and imported €333.4 billion, resulting in a €198.2 billion trade surplus, according to Eurostat. If services are added the picture however is more balanced as the US registers a surplus in this segment. The difference between EU exports to the US and US exports to the EU stood at €48 billion in 2023; the equivalent of just 3% of the total trade between the EU and the US.",,,,,,
Analyst 2,21,,"According to “India Private Equity Report 2025”, released by Bain & Co and Indian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (IVCA) on Tuesday, the number of PEs involved in deals in India has gone up by over 60-65 per cent between 2016, when there were between 100 and 110 funds, to as many as 170-180 funds in 2024. It represents a CAGR (compound annual growth rate) of 6-7 per cent in the last eight years.

To look at the trend from another perspective, small buyouts ($250 million and below) continued to gain share, making up to 68 per cent of all buyouts in 2024 compared to only 55 per cent in 2023, and 40 per cent in 2022. Buyouts in the $500 million-1 billion category have also risen from 9 per cent in 2023 to 14 per cent in 2024 across all such deals.

Data shows that buyout deals of over $100 million in which PEs exited within five years have shown a marked decline — they went down from 46 per cent for deals done in FY16 to only 37 per cent for deals signed up in FY19.

The percentage of deals in which PEs realised their entire returns went down declined from 38 per cent to more than half at 17 per cent in the same period. In simple terms, it means that in 2025, nearly 83 per cent of deals that are over five years old could come up for exits, partial or complete, giving a big push to exits.
